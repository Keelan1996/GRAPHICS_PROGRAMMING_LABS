# GRAPHICS_PROGRAMMING_LABS

## In this repository is my Graphics Programming labs. We were given these labs to complete ourselves each week. All of the labs together were worth 30% of the whole module. 
## Each week they were graded. Every folder has a PDF of what work we had to complete.

## Lab 1-7 were written in Javascript on Notepad++. Lab 8 was written in C# on Unity, Lab 9 was written in python on Visual Studio Code.
